# Hybrid Proctor Documentation 

Welcome to the Hybrid Proctor - ISC Exam System Documentation.

## Overview

This system provides a streamlined and secure platform for educators to administer examinations to students using their personal computers. 

The foundation of this system is a specialized [router](router/index.md), which hosts the examination statement and any additional resources that the educator wishes to provide. Upon setup, students can connect to the router via WiFi, granting them access to a dedicated examination webpage while restricting them an internet access. 

From this webpage, students can download necessary resources and, upon completion, submit their work. The submitted files are then conveniently stored on the router, ready for educators to retrieve via SFTP.
